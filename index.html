    <h1>Milkha Singh</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>
        Milkha Singh (20 November 1929 â€“ 18 June 2021),[a][1] also known as The Flying Sikh, was an Indian track and
        field sprinter who was introduced to the sport while serving in the Indian Army. He is the only athlete to win
        gold at 400 metres at the Asian Games as well as the Commonwealth Games. He also won gold medals in the 1958 and
        1962 Asian Games. He represented India in the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne, the 1960 Summer Olympics in
        Rome and the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo. He was awarded the Padma Shri, India's fourth-highest civilian
        honour, in recognition of his sporting achievements.

        The race for which Singh was best remembered is his fourth-place finish in the 400 metres final at the 1960
        Olympic Games, which he had entered as one of the favourites. He led the race till the 200m mark before easing
        off, allowing others to pass him. Various records were broken in the race, which required a photo-finish and saw
        American Otis Davis being declared the winner by one-hundredth of a second over German Carl Kaufmann. Singh's
        fourth-place time of 45.73 seconds was the Indian national record for almost 40 years.

        From beginnings that saw him orphaned and displaced during the Partition of India, Singh has become a sporting
        icon in his country. In 2008, journalist Rohit Brijnath described Singh as "the finest athlete India has ever
        produced".[2]

        Singh died of COVID-19 complications on 18 June 2021.

    <h1>Early Life</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>
        Milkha Singh was born on 20 November 1929. He was born in a Sikh family of Rathore Rajput origin.[3] His
        birthplace was Govindpura,[4] a village 10 kilometres (6.2 mi) from Muzaffargarh city in Punjab Province,
        British India (now Muzaffargarh District, Pakistan). He was one of 15 siblings, eight of whom died before the
        Partition of India. He was orphaned during the Partition when his parents, a brother and two sisters were killed
        in the violence that ensued. He witnessed these killings.[2][4][5][6]

        Escaping the troubles in Punjab, where killings of Hindus and Sikhs were continuing,[5] by moving to Delhi,
        India, in 1947, Singh lived for a short time with the family of his married sister[4] and was briefly imprisoned
        at Tihar jail for travelling on a train without a ticket. His sister, Ishvar, sold some jewellery to obtain his
        release.[6][7] He spent some time at a refugee camp in Purana Qila and at a resettlement colony in Shahdara,
        both in Delhi.[4]

        Singh became disenchanted with his life and considered becoming a dacoit[b] but was instead persuaded by one of
        his brothers, Malkhan, to attempt recruitment to the Indian Army. He successfully gained entrance on his fourth
        attempt, in 1951, and while stationed at the Electrical Mechanical Engineering Centre[8] in Secunderabad he was
        introduced to athletics. He had run the 10 km distance to and from school as a child and was selected by the
        army for special training in athletics after finishing sixth in a compulsory cross-country run for new
        recruits.[5][6] Singh has acknowledged how the army introduced him to sport, saying that "I came from a remote
        village, I didn't know what running was, or the Olympics".[2][5]

        International career
        Singh represented India in the 200m and 400m competitions of the 1956 Melbourne Olympic Games.[9] His
        inexperience meant that he did not progress from the heat stages but a meeting with the eventual 400m champion
        at those Games, Charles Jenkins, both inspired him to greater things and provided him with information about
        training methods.[2]

        In 1958, Singh set records for the 200m and 400m in the National Games of India, held at Cuttack,[8] and also
        won gold medals in the same events at the Asian Games. He then won a gold medal in the 400m (440 yards at this
        time) competition at the 1958 British Empire and Commonwealth Games with a time of 46.6 seconds.[7] This latter
        achievement made him the first gold medalist at the Commonwealth Games from independent India.[6] Before Vikas
        Gowda won the gold in 2014, Milkha was the only Indian male to have won an individual athletics gold medal at
        those Games.[10]

        Singh was persuaded by Jawaharlal Nehru to set aside his memories of the Partition era to race successfully in
        1960 against Abdul Khaliq in Pakistan, where a post-race comment by the then General Ayub Khan led to him
        acquiring the nickname of The Flying Sikh.[c] Some sources say that he set a world record of 45.8 seconds in
        France,[8] shortly before the Rome Olympics in the same year but the official report of the Games lists the
        record holder as Lou Jones, who ran 45.2 at Los Angeles in 1956.[11] At those Olympics, he was involved in a
        close-run final race in the 400m competition, where he was placed fourth.[5][6] Singh had beaten all the leading
        contenders other than Otis Davis, and a medal had been anticipated because of his good form. However, he made an
        error when leading the race at 250m, slowing down in the belief that his pace could not be sustained and looking
        round at his fellow competitors. Singh believes that these errors caused him to lose his medal opportunity and
        they are his "worst memory".[8] Davis, Carl Kaufmann and Malcolm Spence all passed him, and a photo-finish
        resulted. Davis and Kaufman were both timed at a world-record breaking 44.9 seconds, while Spence and Singh went
        under the pre-Games Olympic record of 45.9 seconds, set in 1952 by George Rhoden and Herb McKenley, with times
        of 45.5 and 45.6 seconds, respectively.[11][7] The Age noted in 2006 that "Milkha Singh is the only Indian to
        have broken an Olympic track record. Unfortunately he was the fourth man to do so in the same race"[12] but the
        official Olympic report notes that Davis had already equalled the Rhoden/McKenley Olympic record in the
        quarter-finals and surpassed it with a time of 45.5 seconds in the semi-finals.[11]

        At the 1962 Asian Games, held in Jakarta, Singh won gold in the 400m[7] and in the 4 x 400m relay.[13] He
        attended the 1964 Olympic Games in Tokyo, where he was entered to compete in the 400m, the 4 x 100m relay and
        the 4 x 400m relay.[14] He did not take part in either the 400m[15] or the 4 x 100m relay[d] and the Indian team
        of Milkha Singh, Makhan Singh, Amrit Pal and Ajmer Singh were eliminated when they finished fourth in the heat
        stages of the 4 x 400m.[17]

        There have been claims that Singh won 77 of his 80 races,[8] but these are spurious. The number of races in
        which he participated is not verified, nor is the number of victories, but he lost a 400m race at the 1964
        National Games in Calcutta to Makhan Singh[18] and he did not finish first in any of his four races at the 1960
        Olympic Games[11] or the aforementioned qualification races at the 1956 Olympics.

        Singh's time in the 1960 Olympics 400m final, which was run on a cinder track, set a national record that stood
        until 1998 when Paramjit Singh exceeded it on a synthetic track and with fully automatic timing that recorded
        45.70 seconds. Although Singh's Olympic result of 45.6 seconds had been hand-timed, an electronic system at
        those Games had determined his record to be 45.73.[19]

    <h1>Later life</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>
        Singh was promoted from the rank of sepoy to junior commissioned officer in recognition of his successes in the
        1958 Asian Games.[20][e] He subsequently became Director of Sports in Punjab Ministry of Education,[8] a post he
        retired from in 1998.[19]

        Singh was awarded the Padma Shri, India's fourth-highest civilian award, following his success in 1958. In 2001,
        he turned down an offer of the Arjuna Award from the Indian government, arguing that it was intended to
        recognise young sports people and not those such as him. He also thought that the Award was being
        inappropriately given to people who had little notable involvement as active sports people at all. He said that
        "I have been clubbed with sportspersons who are nowhere near the level that I had achieved" and that the award
        had become devalued.[21][22] While sharing his experience in a college in Goa in 2014, he stated, "The awards
        nowadays are distributed like 'prasad' in a temple. Why should one be honoured when he or she has not achieved
        the benchmark for the award? I rejected the Arjuna I was offered after I received the Padma Shri. It was like
        being offered an SSC [secondary school] certificate after securing a Masters degree."[23]

        All of Singh's medals have been donated to the nation. They were displayed at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium in
        New Delhi and later moved to a sports museum in Patiala,[8] where a pair of running shoes that he wore in Rome
        are also displayed.[24] In 2012, he donated the Adidas shoes that he had worn in the 1960 400m final to be sold
        in a charity auction organised by actor Rahul Bose.[25]

        Singh was admitted to the intensive care unit at Fortis Hospital in Mohali on 24 May 2021 with pneumonia caused
        by COVID-19. His condition was, for a while, described as stable, but he died on 18 June 2021 at 11:30 pm in
        Chandigarh.[26] His wife, Nirmal Saini, had died a few days earlier on 13 June 2021, also due to COVID-19.[27]
        Singh was laid on his funeral pyre with a photo of his wife in his hands.[28]
